# Repository Information

This repository is a renamed version of my other repository **twitter-clone-Maggie-Tech-Blog**. 

The content and functionality are exactly the same, but the repository name was changed for the purpose of meeting assignment submission requirements and not affecting deployment. 

Thank you!
